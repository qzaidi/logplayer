logplayer
---------

Logplayer is a non real time web access log player. Why non real time? Because real time tools don't work when you want to 
analyze a problem past its occurence.

In conjunction with tools like apachetop and goaccess, this can come in handy - helps you figure out what was happening at 
a particular point in time when something went bad.
